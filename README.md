# AstroPlant Stress Simulator

A lightweight Python simulator of **plant growth under spaceflight stressors**  
(microgravity, radiation, nutrient limits, and light variations).  
The simulator visualizes plant adaptation on the **ISS, Moon, and Mars**  
using adjustable parameters, growth curves, and CSV outputs.


## Features
- Adjustable parameters: gravity, radiation, nutrients, and light
- Predefined scenarios: Earth, Moon + Radiation, Mars + Low Nutrients, ISS Microgravity
- Random variability for realistic simulation
- CSV output of growth data
- Growth curve plots for easy comparison


## Installation
Clone the repository and install required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/astroplant-stress-sim.git
cd astroplant-stress-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
